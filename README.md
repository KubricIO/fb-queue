Hi there,

I am sorry to contact you like this, but issues are disabled for this project and you do not have an e-mail listed on you project page.

I have created a fork of Firebase Queue that you might want to use as a basis for your work: https://github.com/kaliberjs/firebase-queue

I have no idea if it is helpfull at all, you can look at the source code and see if it helps you :-)


Cheers, Erik
